# When I was using a slow HDD, each time I opened a new shell, nvm would significantly slow down the startup
# To mitigate this, I made some aliases to load nvm later, when needed
# This behaviour is now disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting JSH_LOAD_NVM_LATER=x

# Apart from PREFIX, there is also NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX

	# It is too slow to run nvm for every shell that starts up.

	# Although if we did it during X startup, and the vars were exported to all desktop terminals, that might be good enough.
	# (But beware this might not work smoothly.  I think Fluxbox starts up with sh.  Does nvm work in sh?!  If not, Fluxbox might not start at all!)

	# Our current approach is to not run npm, but use the version of node installed on the system.
	# This version of node will let us run simple/common tools like jsbeautify.
	# When actually working on a Node project, we will need to run nvm to select a more recent version of Node.
	# But actually nvm has trouble with the PREFIX which I like to set.
	# For that reason, we offer functions below for running nvm.
	# Although in fact these do little more than `unset PREFIX` and `unset NODE_PATH`

	# Use the node package manually installed in /usr/local
	#export PATH="/usr/local/node/bin:$PATH"

	# Otherwise there may be a nodejs package installed via dpkg or rpm

	# I like to keep my global packages in "$HOME/npm", to avoid conflicts with ownership in /usr/local/node

	# Assuming you have previously done: npm config set prefix ~/npm
	# BUT THIS IS UNDESIRABLE if you might want to use nvm later, because nvm cannot handle prefix in ~/.npmrc
	#export PATH="$HOME/npm/bin:$PATH"

	# So a friendlier way is to set the PREFIX var.  (Too bad they didn't call this NODE_PREFIX or NPM_PREFIX)
	#export PREFIX="$HOME/npm"
	#export PATH="$PREFIX/bin:$PATH"

	if [ -d "$HOME/.yarn/bin" ]

		# Ideally we would add "$(yarn global bin)" but we might not have yarn on the path until after we have loaded node
		export PATH="$HOME/.yarn/bin:$PATH"
	fi

	# The code below assumes that we have nvm installed.

	# Even with this, when I want to do `nvm use` I must first do `unset PREFIX`.

	# Becuase it is slow to run nvm for every shell, we don't run it.
	# We should have started in a state that can use the local (system) node just fine.
	# But nonetheless I want to warn myself if I try to use the local node without explicitly deciding it, because I might have been intending to use the latest.
	# Perhaps a first time warning per shell would be enough.

# Just notes on using nvm, for me:
#
# nvm install 1.2.3 --reinstall-packages-from=default
#
#   will install version 1.2.3 of node, and also install all global packages from your default node version
#
# To do it after an install:
#
#   nvm use iojs; nvm reinstall-packages node, or nvm install iojs --reinstall-packages-from=iojs
#
