# What is useful in this file?
#
# Shortcuts:
#
#   gs ga gc gd gb gco and gm are simple aliases for git status, add, commit,
#   diff, branch, checkout and merge.  Use them to save yourself keystrokes.
#
# Useful tools (the really good stuff!):
#
#   gbs [-M] [.] is "git branch status", a nice way to see which branches are
#   up-to-date with the remote (which need a push, pull or merge).
#
#   gbd [-M] [-r] is "git branch by date", a nice way to see which branches
#   were recently updated.  -r shows remote branches.
#
#   The -M argument to the above commands is slower, but will display whether
#   or not each branch has been merged into the current branch.  Cool!
#
#   They will only align neatly into columns if you have jsh's columnise-clever
#   installed.  Making that work independently is something I should TODO!
#
# And more shortcuts:
#
#   gdc shows the "cached" diff of what is staged (what you are about to commit).
#
#   gll shows a log *overview*, with one commit per line.
#
#   gl is my favourite *detailed* log display, showing diffs, stats and commit
#   messages.  Keys n and N jump forwards/backwords through diffs.
#
#   Both gl and gll show the graph.
#
#   gcp lets you select which chunks of code to commit next
#
# I hope these shortcuts and tools will be of use to you.
#
# The other aliases and functions in this file I rarely use (except those which
# are required by the aliases of course).
#
# Some of the functions (gbs, gbd) do not work on Mac OSX / FreeBSD because I
# don't know how to get BSD sed to do search-replace.  However if you have
# installed the GNU coreutils package (e.g. via Homebrew) and GNU sed is on
# the *front* of your path, then they should work fine.

# If you think this file has too many comments in it, try: :hi Comment guifg=#222222

# TODO: Turn the aliases into shellscripts so they are available from vim's command line?
#       Put them somewhere and load them onto the PATH optionally.  (Not everyone will want them.)

# I had problems declaring functions whose name matched pre-existing aliases.  In my case this was when I was loading oh-my-zsh's git plugin before this script was sourced.
# Details: The function name was getting expanded into the alias during the declaration, either causing the declaration to fail syntactically, or to successfully silently declare the function using a different name!
# The behaviour I desired was to override his aliases with my own functions, but keep any of his aliases which did not conflict.
# The most sensible way to avoid expansion is to declare functions explicitly using `function name()` but some older shells do not recognize the `function` syntax, and I would like to support them.
# Another way to avoid expansion is to declare functions using `'name'()` instead of just `name()`.  This worked for zsh but not for bash.
# So finally I had to specifically unalias any function names which I *know* may be alaised elsewhere.
# This is all rather irrelevant now because I am no longer loading oh-my-zsh's git aliases.

}
# The regexp search allows us to quickly skip to the next diff or commit header by pressing `n`.  If you do not wish to jump through the diffs, you have two options:
#   1. Edit the search so it won't hit diff lines.  For example: `/<Left><Left><Left>z<Enter>`.  This will work for the rest of the session.
#   2. Count the number of files in this commit (as shown by --stat), add one, and jump that many times with e.g. `15n`.  This will work just once, so you can use `n` to skip diffs later.

# "Git Log Pure" - the basis for "Git Log Grey" but without colours
# I am not sure how useful -m is.  It shows us the diff of the merge *and* the individual commits from the merged branch, so we see some things twice.  We may want to remove it, or add --no-merges and/or --first-parent, so we can see the individual commits from merged branches, without the merge commits themselves (which would be duplicate information!).  The disadvantage is that by hiding merges, we don't see the correct moment at which the commit entered our local branch.  Perhaps we want to view the merges but not the commits from merged branches!  That is exactly the behaviour of --first-parent; then we should keep -m.  But then we can't see the log messages for those commits.
# So some sensible choices are: -m --first-parent to see the changes at merge time, or neither to see the log messages of individual commits.
# Probably the second is more desirable for gll, the first more desirable for glf or gld (gl).  Especially the first is useful because it shows us the fixed conflict files during a merge.  (So we can check that a merge has not snuck in unwanted code during the conflict resolution.)
# We could also try out --cc or -c options.
# Nah they didn't see helpful.  It's either -m --first-parent or neither.
# I think I originally added -m because I *thought* git log was not showing commit diffs from merged branches.  In fact it does, but it shows them individually, and leaves the merge commit itself empty.
# I am now finding this a little more informative than glg: git log -p --graph --decorate
# I rarely want to use glp directly; I prefer glg because it customizes the color of the commit message.
# OK so I recently had to track down some code which had been deleted/lost during a merge.  I was using git log <filename>.  The *only* way which worked was -c; -cc or neither would not display this line!  So -c all the way... at least for that case!  If -c causes duplicate information to be displayed, perhaps we should use it at the same time as not showing branches.
alias glp='gitlog -p -U2 --stat'
# Here --stat show a quick summary of changed files, before actually showing the diffs.  I rather enjoy this when using 'gl' as it lets me decide from the top of each commit whether there are any files I am interested in, and if not I can happily skip straight to the next commit.  In other situations, e.g. when I am planning to read all the details, --stat is just chaff.
# "Git Log Grey" - Like 'gl' except we present my favourite colors
# This is quite close to: git log --decorate -U2 -p -m --stat
# Curiously the alias shows fewer +++s and ---s on the stat output.
# One "advantage" of our custom format over --decorate is that --decorate shows different colors for different decorations.  Whilst this is nice and informative, it looks a little ugly when it combines with the reverse highlighting from our less search.

# Now trying this out; use glm for old-ish style (merges merged) or use glg to see individual commits without the graph.

alias gl='glg --graph'
# glx is like gl but without my custom format colours and without my Custom_format_bugs.
alias glx='glp --graph'
# Warning: glg and glc duplicate my color settings.  (Which are also set in my ~/.gitconfig.)  Part of the reason I passed everything through glg/glc was to display decorations (commit labels like HEAD and origin/master).  I have since learned this can be achieved by passing --decorate, so we may be able to reduce some duplication that way.
# "Git Log with Merges-combined/merged)" - shows diffs in the merge, does not show individual commits from merged branches
alias glm='glg -m --first-parent'
# It seems to me that -c should be combined with --first-parent, to avoid seeing the same diffs twice (the final actual merge, as well as the commits on the branch)
# When -c is used, -m does nothing (at least in the example I tested)
# I did tests comparing `glg -c` against `glg -m`, and `glg -c --first-parent` against `glg -m --first-parent`.  Whilst -c did show the full diff of manual merges, it also excluded a lot of stuff!  Notably, merges with no conflicts.  (From the manual: "it lists only files which were modified from all parents").  So I don't see any way to see the true patched of manual merges (-c) without also excluding stuff.  Therefore, use -c only when you think you need it!  :P

    # Displays your git branches with a summary of how many commits ahead or behind the local is from its remote branch.
    # Also displays (through color/labels) which branches are ancestors of (have already been merged into) the current branch.

    # If no upstream is set for a branch, it will guess a branch with the same name on origin.
    # Use the 'gbs' alias wrapper below for colors and column alignment.

    # example:
    # $ git branch-status -a
    # dns_check (ahead 1) | (behind 112) origin/master
    # master (ahead 2) | (behind 0) origin/master
    # $ git branch-status
    # master (ahead 2) | (behind 0) origin/master

    # Surely this was a non-local variable leaking out of git_branch_status and has already been fixed.
    # BUG (fixed?): Running gbs after git_branch_status -a -v gives only 1-line output.  Steps to reproduce:
    # Use Mac.  Start jsh in bash (with GNU coreutils etc.).  See gbs works fine.  Now do git_branch_status -a -v, also works fine.
    # Now see gbs only displays one line!
    # From initial tracing, it appeared that the final gbs call only iterates once during the while getopts.
    # Since we need both -v and -a to show more than one line here, we saw only one line.
