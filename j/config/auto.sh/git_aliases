# What is useful in this file?
#
# Shortcuts:
#
#   gs ga gd gc gb gco and gm are simple aliases for git status, add, diff,
#   commit, branch, checkout and merge.  Use them to save yourself keystrokes.
#
#   gll shows a log *overview*, with one commit per line, with graph layout.
#
#   gl is my favourite *detailed* log display, showing diffs, stats and commit
#      messages and graph.  Keys n and N jump forwards/backwards through diffs.
#
#   gmo does git merge origin/<current_branch>
#
#   gpo does git push origin <current_branch>
#
#   gss and gsp are git stash save and git stash pop respectively.  gsd shows
#   the patch of your stop stash.
#
# Powerful tools:
#
#   gbs [-M] [.] is "git branch status", a nice way to see which branches are
#       up-to-date with the remote (which need a push and which need a pull).
#
#       Use `gbs .` to show the status of the current branch only (faster).
#
#   gbd [-M] [-r] [-n <num>] is "git branch by date", a nice way to see which
#       branches were recently updated.  -r lists remote branches.
#
#   The -M argument to gbs and gbd is slower, but will display whether or not
#   each branch has been merged into the current branch.  Cool!
#
#   gbd will only align neatly into columns if you have jsh's columnise-clever
#   installed.  Making that work independently is something I should TODO!
#
# Some more shortcuts:
#
#   gap lets you select which chunks of code to stage or commit next
#
#   gdc shows the "cached" diff of what is staged (what you are about to commit).
#
#   gdv and glv open diffs and logs in Vim, folded, for interactive browsing.
#
#   gwinp "git what is not pushed" lists commits on local branch not yet pushed
#   gwinm "git what is not merged" lists new commits from remote not yet merged
#
#   git_status_plus sorts untracked files by modification date, and highlights
#   new files created since you last ran it (so you don't forget to add them).
#
# I hope these shortcuts and tools will be of use to you.
#
# Some of the functions (git_branch_status, git_branch_by_date,
# git_status_plus) will only work on Mac OSX and FreeBSD if you have GNU
# versions of sed, xargs and find near the front of your PATH.

# If you think this file has too many comments in it (you are right), try
# hiding them with: :hi Comment guifg=#222222

# CONSIDER: Turn the aliases into shellscripts so they are available from vim's command line?
#       Put them somewhere and load them onto the PATH optionally.  (Not everyone will want them.)  jsh modules...

# If you happen to be using oh-my-zsh's git plugin, redefining its aliases will throw warnings, so we undefine them first.

# "Git Log Pure" - the basis for "Git Log Grey" but without colours
# I am not sure how useful -m is.  It shows us the diff of the merge *and* the individual commits from the merged branch, so we see some things twice.  We may want to remove it, or add --no-merges and/or --first-parent, so we can see the individual commits from merged branches, without the merge commits themselves (which would be duplicate information!).  The disadvantage is that by hiding merges, we don't see the correct moment at which the commit entered our local branch.  Perhaps we want to view the merges but not the commits from merged branches!  That is exactly the behaviour of --first-parent; then we should keep -m.  But then we can't see the log messages for those commits.
# So some sensible choices are: -m --first-parent to see the changes at merge time, or neither to see the log messages of individual commits.
# Probably the second is more desirable for gll, the first more desirable for glf or gld (gl).  Especially the first is useful because it shows us the fixed conflict files during a merge.  (So we can check that a merge has not snuck in unwanted code during the conflict resolution.)
# We could also try out --cc or -c options.
# Nah they didn't see helpful.  It's either -m --first-parent or neither.
# I think I originally added -m because I *thought* git log was not showing commit diffs from merged branches.  In fact it does, but it shows them individually, and leaves the merge commit itself empty.
# I am now finding this a little more informative than glg: git log -p --graph --decorate
# I rarely want to use glp directly; I prefer glg because it customizes the color of the commit message.
# OK so I recently had to track down some code which had been deleted/lost during a merge.  I was using git log <filename>.  The *only* way which worked was -c; -cc or neither would not display this line!  So -c all the way... at least for that case!  If -c causes duplicate information to be displayed, perhaps we should use it at the same time as not showing branches.
# The --stat option sometimes abbreviates the filenames it displays.  If you need the whole path, use --numstat instead.
alias glp='gitlog -p -U2 --stat'
# Here --stat show a quick summary of changed files, before actually showing the diffs.  I rather enjoy this when using 'gl' as it lets me decide from the top of each commit whether there are any files I am interested in, and if not I can happily skip straight to the next commit.  In other situations, e.g. when I am planning to read all the details, --stat is just chaff.
# "Git Log Grey" - Like 'gl' except we present my favourite colors
# This is quite close to: git log --decorate -U2 -p -m --stat
# Curiously the alias shows fewer +++s and ---s on the stat output.

# It seems to me that -c should be combined with --first-parent, to avoid seeing the same diffs twice (the final actual merge, as well as the commits on the branch)
# When -c is used, -m does nothing (at least in the example I tested)
# I did tests comparing `glg -c` against `glg -m`, and `glg -c --first-parent` against `glg -m --first-parent`.  Whilst -c did show the full diff of manual merges, it also excluded a lot of stuff!  Notably, merges with no conflicts.  (From the manual: "it lists only files which were modified from all parents").  So I don't see any way to see the true patched of manual merges (-c) without also excluding stuff.  Therefore, use -c only when you think you need it!  :P

    # master (ahead 2) | (behind 0) origin/master
    # $ git branch-status

    # BUG (fixed?): Running gbs after git_branch_status -a -v gives only 1-line output.  Steps to reproduce:
    # Use Mac.  Start jsh in bash (with GNU coreutils etc.).  See gbs works fine.  Now do git_branch_status -a -v, also works fine.
    # Now see gbs only displays one line!
    # From initial tracing, it appeared that the final gbs call only iterates once during the while getopts.
    # Since we need both -v and -a to show more than one line here, we saw only one line.
