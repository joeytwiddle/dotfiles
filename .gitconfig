	# One problem is that we might not be pushing *to* the upstream.  Upstream is where we are configured to pull from, not where we push to!  So our upstream might be master, or another branch, when we are actually pushing to the current branch (on the origin).  There is no @{d} or @{p}
	# Another problem is that the upstream might not be set.  I often use origin/branch_name without excplicitly setting/tracking it.

	# Shortcut:
	#winp   = log @{u}..HEAD --oneline
	# This will work if an upstream is not set, but only if 1. We were on the current branch when we last fetched, and 2. We have not pushed since the last fetch (FETCH_HEAD does not update when we push, only when we fetch or pull).
	winp   = log FETCH_HEAD..HEAD --oneline

	# Files that will be pushed:
	topush = diff-index --color --stat FETCH_HEAD

	# So the problem is {u} is where we are pulling from, which might be different from where we are pushing to.  To see what is not pushed, we need to compare against the remote branch we are pushing to.

	# None of the above appear to work properly.  But this works, if you provide the branch_name manually:
	#git log origin/branch_name..branch_name
	# although it shows merges as individual commits, which can be a little confusing.

	# Compare two branches; commits on one branch that are not reachable from another:
	#   git log branchA ^branchB
	# More examples here: http://gitref.org/inspect/

	# This simply runs whatever command you give it in the shell.
	# The advantage is that shell aliases are always run in the root.
	# So for example, you can now do "git exec make" from any sub-folder of your project, to run make in the project's root folder.

	# WARNING: Does not lookup or merge from what each branch is tracking!  Instead it just assumes branch "$local" tracks "remote/$local"
	# To do it properly, we could get hold of the upstream names like this: git for-each-ref refs/heads --format="%(refname:short) -> %(upstream:short)"
	# Also beware, if applied to the current branch, working files will be behind and not updated.  (In my case, git still claimed an empty diff, only noticing the differences after a reset or attempted branch switch!  Git 1.7.10.4)

### The following options are rather more serious, because they affect how git modifies files.



# % git config core.autocrlf true
#
# autocrlf setting tells git to convert the newlines to the system's standard
# when checking out files, and to LF newlines when committing in
#
# I have this disabled for now, concerned about Beeb lookup tables and other binaries.
# [core]
	# autocrlf=true



# % git config branch.autosetupmerge true
#
# tells git-branch and git-checkout to setup new branches so that git-pull(1)
# will appropriately merge from that remote branch.  Recommended.  Without this,
# you will have to add --track to your branch command or manually merge remote
# tracking branches with "fetch" and then "merge".
#
# Disabled because I want git to be as difficult for me as for someone without my config.
#
# Recent versions of git now default to 'true', but that is different from 'always'.
# 'true' only sets up the remote tracking branch when we first check out from a remote branch,
# whereas 'always' also sets one up if we are branching off a local branch (creating a new branch).
#
#[branch]
#	autosetupmerge = true

# In a similar vein, this will make it so that pushes will go the same place that pulls come from:
#[push]
#	default=tracking



# To ignore whitespace
#
# % git config apply.whitespace nowarn
#
# I have this disabled because I use coffeescript, and in general I like
# whitespace to be meaningful!
#
#[apply]
#	whitespace = nowarn
