	#whatisnotpushed = log origin..HEAD --pretty=oneline
	# So use @{u} = upstream instead
	whatisnotpushed = log @{u}..HEAD --pretty=oneline
	# or perhaps just compare against FETCH_HEAD?

	# The following does not work sometimes ("warning: refname 'origin/master' is ambiguous.")
	#whatisnotpushed2 = log origin/master..HEAD --pretty=oneline
	# As an alternative, you can read the "ahead" count on the second line of git status

	# Compare two branches; commits on one branch that are not reachable from another:
	#   git log branchA ^branchB
	# More examples here: http://gitref.org/inspect/

	# This simply runs whatever command you give it in the shell.
	# The advantage is that shell aliases are always run in the root.
	# So for example, you can now do "git exec make" from any sub-folder of your project, to run make in the project's root folder.

### The following options are rather more serious, because they affect how git modifies files.



# % git config core.autocrlf true
#
# autocrlf setting tells git to convert the newlines to the system's standard
# when checking out files, and to LF newlines when committing in
#
# I have this disabled for now, concerned about Beeb lookup tables and other binaries.
# [core]
	# autocrlf=true



# % git config branch.autosetupmerge true
#
# tells git-branch and git-checkout to setup new branches so that git-pull(1)
# will appropriately merge from that remote branch.  Recommended.  Without this,
# you will have to add --track to your branch command or manually merge remote
# tracking branches with "fetch" and then "merge".
[branch]
	autosetupmerge = true



# To ignore whitespace
#
# % git config apply.whitespace nowarn
#
# I have this disabled because I use coffeescript, and in general I like
# whitespace to be meaningful!
#
#[apply]
#	 whitespace = nowarn
