# NOTES:

# Known strange behaviour of the window-cycler (shift-tab-switching) which you should be aware of:
# - If the mouse happens to be over the list, it keeps jumping back to the top of the list when you pause.
# - Does not respect fluxbox tab groupings.  (It cycles through tabbed window as if they were separate; acceptable but a little fine-grained.)
# - Does not cycle through minimised windows.
# - Focuses the window immediately, but only raises it after a short delay.  (I think Fluxbox may be doing the raising.)
# - Does not un-raise windows which were temporarily raised during the cycle.
# - Does not engage if you Ctrl+Alt+Right to change desktop then Alt-Tab but never released Alt!  In this case, Fluxbox cycler engages.

# These are old bugs (from hwi?) which I haven't seen for ages (not on porridge):
# - Mod1 = Alt key, Mod2 = Win key
# - bbkeys sometimes segfaults on Win-Tab!
# - Sometimes after switching desktop, we were left with Fluxbox's window-cycler, not bbkeys.  One time using Win-Tab brought it back.

# Bug when switching desktops:
# - If you switch right then down rapidly, you will end up being transported down only!  But slowly it works fine.

# Update 2014:
# - Current-desktop window cycler seems fairly well behaved on Ubuntu 12.04
# - However multi-desktop window-cycler jumps back to the top of the list whenever it switches desktop.
