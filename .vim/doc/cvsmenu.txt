							    *CVS-Installation*
Installation ~
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General :
  1. Have CVS installed and your $CVSROOT set correctly,
     i.e. calling "cvs status" should work without any
     manual input (password queries, etc).

Vim 6 :
  1. Copy cvsmenu.vim to $VIM/plugins. 
  2. Restart Vim.
  3. Optional: Select "|CVS-Settings-Install|.Install updates"


								   *CVS-Usage*
Usage ~
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When editing a file, CVS commands can be accessed from the menu. All commands
(commit,status,update,...) will affect this file.
To run a CVS command on an entire directory, 
  - use the command from the "Directory" submenu (single run) or
  - use "|CVS-Settings|.Toggle buffer/dir" to use the directory instead of the
    current buffer by default or
  - use the command from a new (no filename!) buffer
  - use the command from inside the fileexplorer
To be asked for revisions when using diff,commit,update,etc., use
"|CVS-Settings-Revision|".
By default, command output is printed to statusline and titlebar, when run on
a single file. It is opened in a new buffer, when run on a directory (can be
changed with "|CVS-Settings-Output|"). 
In the result buffer, you can use <SHIFT-CR> or <DoubleClick> to open the 
listed files in a new window.
Use "|CVS-Directory|.Short Status" to get a short status list of all files
("Up-to-Date", "Needs Patch", etc).
You can use "|CVS-LocalStatus|" to display status in offline mode.
To get help use ":help cvs", ":help cvs-add", ":he -upd", etc.
Executing a CVS command, which is not directly supported by this script, is
possible with the |:CVS| command : It executes the given command and uses all
the scripts settings on it (e.g. filtering, presets,...).


								    *CVS-Tips*
TIPS ~
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Read the CVS documentation (e.g. http://www.cvshome.org).
- Use "|CVS-Info|" to display or |CVS-Settings-Info| to change current
  settings.  If a "CVS" directory is found, info from "Root" and "Repository"
  are displayed below the current working directory.  Change a coloured
  options and set it with <SHIFT-CR> or a <DoubleClick>.
- Use |CVS-Variables| to setup CVS from your vimrc.
- Set $CVSROOT to your repository, including the access method, e.g.
  ":pserver:user@host:dir". When using ssh (:ext:), set $CVS_RSH to "ssh".
  The CVSROOT from CVS subdirectory has higher priority.
- To override settings from CVS subdir, pass it using "$CVSOPT" :
    let $CVSOPT='-z9 -d:ext:user@host:/cvsroot'
- By default, you are not asked for revisions, for easier usage.  To enable
  revision queries, use "|CVS-Settings-Revision| queries".  You will then be
  able to "diff" (or "commit", etc.) to certain revisions and branches.
- To enable revision queries by default, add ":let g:CVSqueryrevision=1" to
  your .vimrc. Take a look at "|CVS-Info|" for further options, you may set.
- To update to a certain revision or to merge in changes from another branch,
  you may use "|CVS-Extra|.Update" (uses "-r" flag) or "|CVS-Extra|.Merge"
  (uses one or two "-j" flags), which will request the needed revision
  numbers.
- If there are conflicts during Merge, conflicting regions are highlighted.
- To use this script from non-GUI, you may either use wildmenus (see
  |CVS-Troubleshooting| section) or the keymapping, that is identical to the
  GUI-hotkeys, except you have to use <Leader> instead of <ALT>. >
  	\ci = <ALT>ci = CVS.Commit
- To get the full command output printed to statusline/titlebar, use
  "|CVS-Settings-Output|.Uncompressed"
- Vim's builtin :diff overwrites some settings (see |CVS-Diff| for details).
  Cvsmenu has some functions to save and restore them, which may be useful as
  a keymapping (see |CVS-Functions| for details).
  To select/unselect current window for diffing, add this to your vimrc : >
	:nmap <F9> :call CVSSwitchDiffMode()<cr>
- Keymappings in output window
	q		deletes that buffer
	<shift-cr>	open file in new buffer (or <doublecllick>)
- Keymappings in CVSDiff window
	q		deletes that buffer
	<tab>		jump to next diff
	<s-tab>		jump to previous diff 


							       *CVS-Variables*
Variables ~
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cvsmenu can be configured by setting following variables (may also be copied
from output of |CVS-Settings-Info| screen).

									*:CVS*
:CVS command ~
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sometimes you may need to call CVS with options, not provided by this script.
This is possible  using the |:CVS| ex-command. It calls CVSDoCommand()
(see |CVS-Functions|) and passes the given arguments.
The CVS command will use the settings (e.g. variables like $CVSCMD) and output
processing (dump to titlebar, etc.) from cvsmenu. >
	:CVS --help-commands
	:CVS export mymodule
<

								    *CVS-Menu*
Menu commands ~
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								    *CVS-Info*
Info : ~
  Display current CVS settings on statusline.
								*CVS-Settings*
							   *CVS-Settings-Info*
Settings : ~
  Info : ~
    Open current CVS settings in a new buffer.
    After changing an option, set it using <SHIFT-CR> or <DoubleClick>.
							   *CVS-Settings-Diff*
  Diff : ~
    Stay in original : ~
      When using CVSDiff(), do not switch to the diffed file.
    Switch to diffed : ~
      Diffed file is made current (can quickly be closed with "q"). 
    Autorestore prev. mode : ~
      When closing a |CVS-Diff| result, restore settings as foldcolumn, etc.
      NOTE: This only works, if you dont diff more than two files at once.
      Otherwise you have to use "Restore pre-diff mode" from the menu, to
      restore settings that were backed up when cvsmenu was started.
    No autorestore : ~
      Disable automatic save/restore previous setting.
    Restore pre-diff mode : ~
      Resets options changed by :diffsplit to the state, cvsmenu was run.
      When using Vim's builtin :diffsplit, following options are not
      reset, when the diffed window is closed:
	'diff',	'scrollbind', 'wrap', 
	'foldcolumn', 'foldenable', 'foldlevel', 'foldmethod'
      NOTE: This command works with |:diffsplit| as well as |CVS-Diff|.
      For quick access, you may either use standard menu mapping (<ALT-c>gds)
      or create a custom "nodiff" keymapping, such as : >
 		:nmap <S-F10> :call CVSRestoreDiffMode()<cr>
<
							 *CVS-Settings-Output*
  Output : ~
					    *CVS-Settings-Output-Notification*

  asked for the message.


							       *CVS-Functions*
Functions ~
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can call cvsmenu functions from other scripts to automate certain tasks,
e.g. call CVSLogin() when opening a projectfile, combine CVSCheckout() and
CVSEdit(), download files,...

CVSSwitchDiffMode() ~
  Useful for keymapping: Toggles diffmode for the current window.
CVSRestoreDiffMode() ~
  Cvsmenu keeps a beckup of options, modified by Vim's builtin :diffsplit 
  (see |CVS-Settings-Diff|), when it is started.
  These settings can be restored using this function.
  It is possible to create a snapshot of these options any time using
  CVSBackupDiffMode().
CVSInstallAsHelp(destname) ~
  Writes local buffer to local help directory and runs ":helptags"
CVSInstallAsPlugin(destname) ~
  Writes local buffer to $VIMRUNTIME/plugins
CVSMappingFromMenu(filename,...) ~
  Reads a vimscript and generates Keymapping, using <Leader> (or an optional
  arg.) and the underlined Menuhotkey.

CVSGet(...) ~
  Parameters :
    1 : filename   : if not given, filename AND repository are queried
    2 : repository : optional
    3 : login/out  : 'i':login, 'o':logout (may be combined)
    4 : password   : omitted:ask, '':none
  Download single file from repository into new buffer - does not create 
  or modify any files/directories.
  This may be useful for keeping files in sync across networks (e.g. using 
  ssh over internet) without creating any "CVS" directories. >
    call CVSGet("hosts",":ext:admin@cvs.dom:/netconf")
    call CVSGet( "VimTools/cvsmenu.vim",  
               \ ":pserver:anonymous@cvs.ezytools.sf.net","io",'')
CVSSaveOpts() ~
  Saves all |CVS-Variables| (dont call twice !)
CVSRestoreOpts() ~
  Restores all |CVS-Variables|.
CVSDoCommand(cmd,...) ~
  Executes CVS command on current buffer/directory, opens output in a new
  buffer, applies syntax highlighting and keymappings.
CVSadd(), CVScommit, CVSshortstatus(),etc ~
  Execute menu commands.


							 *CVS-Troubleshooting*
Troubleshooting ~
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No menu at all : ~
  You need the GUI-Version to use menus.
  WRONG! Use ":help console-menus" to see how to use menus in text mode.

  If there are lots of error messages, you may have the wrong fileformat
  (win/unix cr/lf). Use ":set ff=dos" or ":set ff=unix" (and write changes) to
  correct this.

Commands "hang" after execution : ~
  This happens, if cvs awaits user input or cannot access the $CVSROOT. This
  may also be caused by a password query from ssh.

  Check your $CVSROOT setting when checking out.
  Check if the host given as "Root" (use "|CVS-Info|") is reachable.
  Execute the cvs command manually from the command line.
  
Changing $CVSROOT has no effect : ~
  If the working directory is controlled by CVS (i.e. it has a subdir "CVS"),
  these settings have higher priority than $CVSROOT.
  To override these settings, use "-d" in $CVSOPT : >
	let $CVSOPT=-d :ext:user@host:/dir

Manual helpfile installation : ~
  1. Create the directory "~/.vim/doc/".
  2. Get cvsmenu.txt (e.g. using |CVS-Info|) and copy it there.
  3. Use ":helptags ~/.vim/doc" to built the tags.

Help cannot be installed, ~
Help cannot be found, ~
CVS Links cannot be created :~
  Check output of ":echo expand('~')". This should return your home directory.
  On MS-Windows, you have to define $HOME for Vim to expand "~" correctly.

Command results are not displayed : ~
  Command output can either be opened in a new buffer or printed as a
  notification. This can be set using "|CVS-Settings-Output|".
  If output mode is "Notification only" or "Autoswitch", output can be printed
  to statusline and/or titlebar (-->  "|CVS-Settings-Output-Notification|").
  Maybe you disabled both notification methods.

CVS commands work from console, but fail inside Vim : ~
  If you receive messages like
  >
  cvs commit: cannot open CVS/Entries for reading: No such file or directory
  cvs add: in directory .: cvs [add aborted]: there is no version here
<
  Then your shell seems to change the path. This happens e.g. with tcsh if
  "dirs -L" is enabled, to start from the last directory used.
  You can either change the configuration for the shell, or select a different
  shell or config from Vim. To get more info, see
  >
  	:he shell
<

Errors : ~
  - Unknown Option: iff   Invalid Expression:  &diff" ~
    NOTE   DANGEROUS   NOTE
    You are using an old version of Vim (before 6.0ak), which lacks support
    for certain commands like diff and redraw. The redraw is extremely
    necessary to have the CVS work on the right buffer, otherwise your
    currently edited file may be closed without saveing changes !
    Please update to a recent version of Vim (e.g. the full version of Vim 6.0
    is out and working) - you will like its new features !
  - Cannot create diffs ~
    Vim requires an external "diff" program. Make sure you have one installed
    on your system (Windows users may install the Cygwin package from 
    http://www.redhat.com - it contains (beneath a lot of other -very- helpful
    unix tools) such a programm.
  - Cannot create to /temp/VIafoo.tmp ~
    (or similar messages)
    This message may be misleading: It also occurs, when an external program
    cannot be found (may happen on :make, :grep, diff-commands,...). This was
    also a problem in the Alpha and Beta versions of Vim 6.0 under Win9x, 
    which is solved in the final release.
