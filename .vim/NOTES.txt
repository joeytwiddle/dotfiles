When diffing two files:
  ]c   go to next difference
  [c   go to previous difference
  do   obtain lines for current difference from other file
  dp   put lines in current difference into other file
[The last two are nice of you are in the left-hand window, as O and P indicate
the direction of movement of text (on a QWERTY keyboard).]

Editing a privileged file but not root?
  :w !sudo tee %
  (here :w ! write to stdin of the command, and % evaluates to a filename)

In Insert mode:

  Ctrl-O lets you do ONE normal command (that's what I need for gvim -y!)

  Ctrl-A inserts the last insert again (in normal mode that is in register ".)

  Ctrl-Y insert the char from cell above the cursor

Execute a register as a command using @

  so @0 or @1 or @""

If you made some deletes and you want an earlier delete, they are stored in the numbered registers, so...

  "3p   will paste the yanked text 3 steps back

g;   go to position of last change
g,   go to position of next change
mx   create mark x
g'x  jump to mark x
     (use capital X for global, lower-case is buffer-local)

Whilst n is the repeater for * or #, ; is the repeater for f t F and T.

Lost code by breaking your undo history?  Recover with:
  :earlier 1m
  :later 10s
Alternatively:
  :u1 | u   go to initial state
  :earlier 1f   go to state at previous file-save

Delete and yank current word, with "in":

  diw   delete current word
  di(   delete current parens
  di"   delete text between quotes
  vi{   select text in brackets

gF open file under cursor

gD jump to definition

Paste contents of register from Insert mode:

  <C-r>r     where r is the register

Also:

  :echo @r   Print register r, using its variable

  @/         is the search register

@: is a shortcut for the last : command you ran





Yank matching:

  :g/var/y A     yanks all lines in buffer matching var into register a


Debug where setting was set:
  :verbose set cindent?

To see if a key mapping has been overriden:
  :verbose nmap \

Edit file under cursor is gf in case Ctrl-] doesn't work.

Change directory to current folder:
  :cd %:h
  or
  :set autochdir

gv if you want your last visual back

Handy buffer switcher:
  nnoremap <C-B> :ls<CR>:b<space>



Switch to buffer 3 quickly with: 3<Ctrl-^>



Text via external shell/system commands (e.g. grep, awk, perl):

To insert something useful (in this case the date).

  v!date

To filter the current file through an external program:

  :%!sort -k 3

  :%!grep -v "/mnt/sdb1/"

Hex / binary editor:

  :%!xxd
  :%!xxd -r



== Basic stuff (for new Vim users) ==

Undo and other commands to get out of bad situations:

  u           undo
  Ctrl-r      redo

  Ctrl-o      go back (when you have changed file and want the old one)
  Ctrl-i      go forward

  Ctrl-w c    close window (when you have split open a new window and don't want it)
  or :q
