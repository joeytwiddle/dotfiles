== Advanced and useful vim stuff ==

When diffing two files:
  ]c   go to next difference
  [c   go to previous difference
  do   obtain lines for current difference from other file
  dp   put lines in current difference into other file
[The last two are nice of you are in the left-hand window, as O and P indicate
the direction of movement of text (on a QWERTY keyboard).]

Editing a privileged file but realise when saving you are not root?
  :w !sudo tee %
  (here :w ! writes to stdin of the command, and % evaluates to a filename)

If you made some deletes and you want an earlier delete, they are stored in the numbered registers, so...

  "3p   will paste the yanked text 3 steps back

Before doing that, you can use :reg to see the list of registers.

g;   go to position of last change
g,   go to position of next change
mx   create mark x
g'x  jump to mark x
     (use capital X for global, lower-case is buffer-local)
'.   go to last edited line (similar to g; but without steps)

In Insert mode:

  Ctrl-O lets you do ONE normal command (that's what I need for gvim -y!)

  Ctrl-A inserts the last insert again (in normal mode that is in register ".)

  Ctrl-Y inserts the char from the cell above the cursor (copy line above)

Execute a register as a command using @

  so @0 or @1 or @""

@: is a shortcut for the last : command you ran

Whilst n is the repeater for * or #, ; is the repeater for f t F and T.

Lost code by breaking your undo history?  Recover with:
  :earlier 1m
  :later 10s
Alternatively:
  :u1 | u   go to initial state
  :earlier 1f   go to state at previous file-save

Delete and yank current word, with "in" or "around":

  diw   delete current word
  d3iw  delete two words: current and next
  d5iw  delete current and next two words (even numbers delete the gaps between words)
  ci"   change text between quotes
  ci(   change text within parens
  vi{   select text within curly brackets
  vib   select text within parents or curlies ("block") depending
  viB   again curlies ("larger block") depending
  da(   delete text including ("around") parens
  cit   change tag

  For more: :help text-objects

gF open file under cursor

gD jump to definition

Paste contents of register from Insert mode (or on Cmdline):

  <C-r>r     where r is the register

Also:

  :echo @r   Print register r, using its variable

  @/         is the search register

Read input from a command.

  :r!date     inserts a new line
  :.!date     clobbers the current line

Uppercase the word under the cursor:

   viwU
   vi(U      or everything inside the parentheses



Yank matching:

  :g/var/y A     yanks all lines in buffer matching var into register a


Debug where setting was set:
  :verbose set cindent?

To see if a key mapping has been overriden:
  :verbose nmap \

Edit file under cursor is gf in case Ctrl-] doesn't work.

Change directory to current folder:
  :cd %:h
  or
  :set autochdir

gv if you want your last visual back

Handy buffer switcher:
  nnoremap <C-B> :ls<CR>:b<space>



Switch to buffer 3 quickly with: 3<Ctrl-^>



Text via external shell/system commands (e.g. grep, awk, perl):

To insert something useful (in this case the date).

  v!date

To filter the current file through an external program:

  :%!sort -k 3

  :%!grep -v "/mnt/sdb1/"

Hex / binary editor:

  :%!xxd
  :%!xxd -r

  (Note that vim should be run in -b binary mode.)



== Vim Scripting ==

=== Debugging ===

Some bugs are caused by incompatible settings or plugins.  To start a vanilla Vim without them:

    vim -N -u NONE -U NONE --noplugin

The `-N` option (nocompatible) means things like `<Up>` will work in command mode.

You may then need to `:source /path/to/script` the scripts you want to debug in isolation.

When debugging vim scripts, `:scriptnames` can be useful to show what has loaded.

To discover when a mapping or autocmd or option was last set, use `:verbose`:

    verbose map [key]
    verbose autocmd [group] [event]
    verbose set [{option}?]

Logging can give you lots of information:

  vim -V9testlog

Alternatively, if you want to turn this heavy logging on/off at runtime:

    function! ToggleVerbose()
        if !&verbose
            set verbosefile=~/vim.log
            set verbose=15
        else
            set verbose=0
            set verbosefile=
        endif
    endfunction

Unfortunately the writing of the logfile is buffered, so you don't get a very realtime view if you try to watch it with `tail -f`.  But with the following mapping, you can force the logfile to update by hitting `<Ctrl-L>`:

    :nmap <C-L> :set verbosefile=<CR>:set verbosefile=~/vim.log<CR>

We could also try to force a write on CursorMoved/CursorHold/... autocommands.

I found the flat format of the logfile a little hard to follow, so I indented each function call like this (using jsh):

    cat /tmp/vim.log | indent_on_regexp "^calling function " "^function.*return" | more

That's logging.  If you want a step by step debugger:

    vim -D ...

But wait.  What about:

    :breakadd

I need to experiment with that, so I can document it.

See Tim Pope's 'scriptease' for some friendly wrappers for verbose.



=== Profiling Startup ===

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1687799/profiling-vim-startup-time

    vim --startuptime /tmp/vim-profile.log


=== Profiling Runtime ===

To start profiling:

    :profile start ~/vimprofile.out
    :profile file *
    :profile func *

You can also:

    :profile pause
    :prfile continue

The output file will only be written when you quit Vim.


=== Debugging Runtime ===

    :set verbosfile=/tmp/vim-log.out
    :set verbose=15



Stop leaving Insert mode to paste from clipboard:

  <Esc>"+p

Stay in Insert mode and do it faster:

  <Ctrl-R>+

Rather than :set ignorecase to do a case-insensitive search, just drop \c at the beginning of your search expression!

To copy the line under the cursor (into register k) then execute it as an ex command:

  "kyy
  :@k<Enter>

or:

  yyq:p<Enter>



== More Tips ==

http://rayninfo.co.uk/vimtips.html



== Basic stuff (for new Vim users) ==

Undo and other commands to get out of bad situations:

  u           undo
  Ctrl-r      redo

  Ctrl-o      go back (when you have changed file and want the old one)
  Ctrl-i      go forward

  Ctrl-w c    close window (when you have split open a new window and don't want it)
  or :q


== Completion ==

  Ctrl-n           word completion forwards
  Ctrl-p           word completion backwards (more often what you want)
  Ctrl-x Ctrl-]    tag completion (from ctags)
  Ctrl-x Ctrl-n    context-aware completion (keep hitting it to pull in words from earlier sentences)
  Ctrl-x Ctrl-o    language-aware completion
  Ctrl-x Ctrl-l    line completion


== Motions ==

  [count]G         to line [count] inclusive
                   use with 'c' or 'd' to clear lots of lines
                   easier when 'number' is enabled!

== Jumps ==

  Ctrl-o           go back one jump
  Ctrl-i           go forward one jump
  Ctrl-t           go back one tag jump
                   (a good alternative to my custom Ctrl-u)

== Scrolling ==

  zt         Scroll so cursor is at top
  zz         Scroll so cursor is in middle
  zb         Scroll so cursor is at bottom



<m_ben> sec^nd: for autocompletion, take a look at YouCompleteMe. it's a pain in the ass to set it up but once it's running it works pretty well
<m_ben> if you want a more lightweight completion 'plugin', there's µcomplete or VimCompletesMe
