" 20120618 - Switched to using match instead of a syntax rule, since I can't
"            see a way to do containedin=*.  This stops the temporary rule
"            from breaking the syntax parser and slowing vim down.
"
"            One disadvantage is that these matches will override and mask the
"            last hlsearch performed with /, so that may disappear and appear,
"            unlike the original behaviour.

" To disable the script, set g:hiword=0 in your .vimrc, or at runtime
