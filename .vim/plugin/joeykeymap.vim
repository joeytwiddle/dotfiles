" BUG: In Vim and GVim on Mac OSX, <C-J> also gets mapped to <NL>.  As a result, the mapping above fires in visual mode, preventing the selection from growing, and making Vim jitter while the cursor does not move down.  (Or before the gv trick above, it would just drop us out of visual mode.)  We only see this mapping firing (or causing problems) when a very long wrapped line moves off screen, causing a visual jump to occur.  If I unmap <NL> then this also unmaps <C-J>.
"
" Here are the earlier notes I wrote in sexy_scroller.txt about this bug:
"
" - I was trying to create a visual selection (blockwise or not) by holding down `<Enter>` but the buffer had some very long wrapped lines, with `wrap` enabled.  Vim kept dropping out of Visual mode and into Normal mode!  It looked like this was when one of the long wrapped lines moved out of view (causing a jump of four visual lines).  Taglist was not loaded, but I did have a very high keyboard repeat.  This was on Vim 7.14 (homebrew) under iTerm on Mac OSX Mavericks.
"
"  One clue was left on the command-line: `:call g:SexyScroller_ScrollToCursor()`  But that is never actually performed by this plugin; it is one of my other plugins making that call!  That looked like it might be the result of one of my `<C-K>` or `<C-J>` mappings, but it continued to occur even with those disabled.  Curiously it only happened when holding `<Enter>`, not when holding `j`, even though I have no particular visual (or normal) mapping on `<Enter>`.
"
"  Aha!  Here is the mapping that caused it:
"
"    :verb map <NL>
"    ov <NL>        * 2<C-E>:call g:SexyScroller_ScrollToCursor()<CR>
"            Last set from ~/rc_files/.vim/plugin/joeykeymap.vim
"
"  So it looks like when I set the `<C-J>` mapping, it also created a `<NL>` mapping.
