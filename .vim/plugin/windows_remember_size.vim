" == New version: tries to automatically keep up without whatever layout changes
" you make, by storing an unfocused and focused size for each window. ==
"
" Explanation: Whenever you leave a window, it remembers what size it was, and
" whenever you enter a window, it remembers what size it was before entering.
" Thus it records "focused" and "unfocused" sizes for each window, and it will
" try to grow/shrink windows on entering/leaving, to match the recorded value.
"
" Warning: This system is not perfect, specifically when opening a new window
" (changing the layout) it has no strategy and will often squash the new
" window when it is unfocused (because other windows remember their old sizes,
" so don't leave any space for the new window).
"
" Solution: The best approach appears to be, as soon as your layout breaks in
" some way, fix it immediately with 20<C-W>+ or whatever, to minimize the
" damage (before the new broken values get recorded).  This is a small work
" overhead for the user, which he must exchange for the beneficial features of
" this script!

" Options:
"
" New feature: Set a default height for newly split windows, as percentage of
" the size of the original window.  Without it Vim usually splits 50-50.
"

"
" We "detect" when a split is about to occur by mapping <Ctrl-W>s and :h
" below.  You may want to add more mappings for other splitting actions.

" BUGS:
" When we add a new window to the list, e.g. TagList, when switching to it, the old unfocused size of the previous window from the *old* layout is applied.
" I think we need to forget some things when layout changes?  Forget all unfocused sizes?
" Or perhaps when a new window enters the layout, we should quickly grab its dimensions and set those as its focused and unfocused size?

" OK I like this version a lot now.  With the exception of the major bugs, which is when new windows are made, sometimes a window will end up 0 height or 0 width.
" When we are thinking of restoring or saving values, we could check the number of windows (or even their names) to see if any change has occured.
" New windows should be encouraged to take 50% of the space I guess, as per Vim's default.

" Perhaps what we should do is have window remember their relative size rather than their actual size.  Would this be a percentage, or a ratio?
" Then what do we do when a new window is created?  Shrink them all by 10%?  Shrink them intelligently?

" TODO: We need :ForgetWidths and :ForgetHeights and :ForgetSizes to disable
" autocmds, so we really can visit every window and forget their w:settings.
" It would be pretty handy sometimes, when the display looks right on this
" window, but old settings are causing trouble on others.
"
" TODO: Do something useful on VimResized event, for example scale all
" remembered sizes proportional to size change, and scale all open windows
" too!  Actually NO to the last bit, and no to scaling TList/MBE/FileExplorer!
" Vim often does what I want to achieve when I enlarge the window, it makes
" the current window grow whilst others stay the same.  Actually TList always
" stays the same width whether it is current window or not.  The only issue is
" height - if the current window is below another then it grows, but if it is
" above another then it doesn't!
