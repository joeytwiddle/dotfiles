" Allows you to review changes between the file saved on the disk and the working buffer.
" Or using the new DiffSplitAgainstFileOnDisk command, compares the two versions using a split window.

" Can be useful if Vim says "File changed on disk. (L)oad or (O)k?" you can
" select OK then do :DiffAgainstFileOnDisk to decide whether to overwrite
" (:w!) or read (:e!) the file.

" Can also be useful if Vim says there is a swapfile: you can (R)ecover it,
" diff it against the file on disk, and then decide whether to keep it or :e!

" It works by writing the current buffer to a temp-file, then it calls GNU diff, or whatever is set in DAFOD_diffcmd.

" TOTEST: Accidentally running on an unnamed buffer may give it name of tmpfile.  Not really a problem, just inconsistent.
