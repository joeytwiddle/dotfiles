" joeys_buffer_switcher: Ctrl-E then type/autocomplete the buffer you want to
" switch to.  If the buffer you wanted is not open, allows autocompletion to a
" filename to open.  If the buffer is open in a window, jumps to that window.

" CONSIDER: If the user enters a number, open that numbered buffer?
" CONSIDER: Allow <file> completion if no matching <buffer> is open.  (Ideally
" we only want file completion IFF buffer completion offers no results).

" BUG TODO:
" It will sometimes take a bad match when a perfect match is available!
" For example, in my Dwitter folder, I can type `ideas.txt` but it will open `fun_ideas.txt` instead of `ideas.txt`!

" BUGS TODO:
" If you press Esc or Ctrl+C it should not proceed to the BufExplorer fallback!
"   The try catch below didn't fix that.
"   Yeah - could not find a way to differentiate between user hitting Enter
"   and user hitting Escape.  FIXEDFORNOW: no BufExplorer fallback
" Also, BufExplorer sometimes requires two presses of Ctrl-O to get out of it.

" I had an issue on Ubuntu 12.04 that Tab-complete was does nothing during the prompt.
" At that time I disabled the plugin and used this fallback:
"nnoremap <C-e> :set nomore <Bar> :ls <Bar> :set more <CR>:b<Space>
"finish

" You are recommended to bind this plugin to a key, for example one of these:
"   nnoremap <C-E> :<C-U>JoeysBufferSwitch<CR>
"   nnoremap <Leader>b :<C-U>JoeysBufferSwitch<CR>

" Some alternatives to this plugin are:
"   nnoremap <C-E> :ls<CR>:b<space>
"   nnoremap <C-B> :BufExplorer<Enter>
"   nnoremap <Leader>b :MRU<Enter>
"   nnoremap <Leader>o :e .<Enter>
"   nnoremap <Leader>f :Explore .<Enter>
