" Dim inactive windows using 'colorcolumn' setting
" This tends to slow down redrawing, but is very useful.
" Based on https://groups.google.com/d/msg/vim_use/IJU-Vk-QLJE/xz4hjPjCRBUJ
" Now shared here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8415828/vim-dim-inactive-split-panes
" XXX: this will only work with lines containing text (i.e. not '~')

" NOTE: One disadvantage of this plugin is that the background highlight set
" on inactive windows may override useful backgrounds.  For example, I use a
" background colour in taglist to indicate the current tag, and a background
" highlight in the QuickFix window to indicate the current 'error' line.
" Those highlights disappear when dim_inactive_windows dims those windows (at
" least on MacVim they do).
